# Brain slicer

## Assembly
See brainMatrix_assembled.stl.  The other three stl files are for printing.

## Procedure
A fresh rat brain is placed in the cutter. Single edge blades are then lowered into the guide slots of the cutter to cut the brain at 1 mm intervals. The slider is then moved out, allowing the cutter to be lowered into the base. The side bars of the base catch the blades and allow the brain sections to be removed one at a time.
