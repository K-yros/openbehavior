# OpenBehavior

This project aims to establish a computing platform for rodent behavior research using the Raspberry Pi computer. We are building devices for conducting operant conditioning, as well as some infrared sensor based assays. We also designed an environmental sensor set that records the temperature, humidity, air pressure, ambient light, noise level, etc. 

These projects are in various stages of development. The following are the most mature projects.

## Operant Licking
This project develops a home cage device for operant licking (fixed ratio, various ratio, or progressive ratio schedules). Detailed description of this project is published in a [PeerJ article]( https://peerj.com/articles/2981/) 


## EnvSensors

This device collects four environmental variables and we have several of them running in the lab. This device is also described in our [PeerJ article](https://peerj.com/articles/2981/)

## RFID 

This project develops a standalone RFID reader for the EM4100 implantable glass chips. We use this daily in the lab.

## Extinction

This device is used to run extinction experiments as described  by [Wang et al. (2014)](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/25532105) 


## Motion

This project adds a motion sensor to standard operant chambers.
