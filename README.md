#OpenBehavior

This project aims to establish a computing platform for rodent behavior research using the Raspberry Pi computer. We are building devices for conducting operant conditioning, as well as some infrared sensor based assays. We also designed an environmental sensor set that records the temperature, humidity, air pressure, ambient light, noise level, etc.
